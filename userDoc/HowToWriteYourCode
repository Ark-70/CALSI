When you write your code you have to respect the following syntax, you can find an example in the file sampleCode.txt
Before your code, your text file must be compose of three compact blocks without any blank line.**
	1)	If you have import to made you have to make them in the beginning of the file, before the first block
	2)	The first block is there for the Shared Variable declaration
	3)	The second block is there for the Shared Variable initialization
	4)	The third block is there for Local Variable declaration
	5)	Then you can write the code of your shared algorithm
**The initialization of the simulation may change in the future, and the usage of block may be outdated soon.

When you write your code you have to respect the following rules:
	1)	The code of your algorithm should be write respecting the Java syntax
	2)	You only can made 1 atomic operation per line
