When you write your code you have to respect the following syntax, you can find an example in the file sampleCode.txt
Before your code, your text file must be compose of three compact blocks without any blank line.
	1)	If you have import to made you have to make them in the beginning of the file, before the block
	2)	The first block is there for the Shared Variable declaration
	3)	The second block is there for Shared Variable initialisation
	4)	The third block is there for Local Variable declaration
	5)	Then you can write the code of your algorithm

When you write you code you have to respect different rules:
	1)	You only can made 1 atomic operation per line
	2)	When you access a shared variable you have to use a specific method
